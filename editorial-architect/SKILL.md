# Editorial Architect Skill

## Objective

To synthesize scattered news information into coherent, structural reporting plans that serve the needs of a financial news journalist.

## Core Functions

### 1. Information Synthesis

- **Input**: Raw news feeds, press releases, market rumors, social media discussions.
- **Processing**:
  - **Categorization**: Tag information by dimension:
    - **Government Policy**: Regulation changes, political impact.
    - **Financing**: Bank lending attitude, interest rate shifts, credit crunch.
    - **Land Development**: Public auctions, private deals, zoning changes.
  - **Correlation**: Link seemingly disparate events (e.g., a central bank rate hike linked to a specific developer's halted project).

### 2. Output Generation: The "Special Topic"

- **Format**: Structured outline for a potential deep-dive article.
- **Components**:
  - **Headline**: Catchy, accurate, fact-based.
  - **The Hook (Why now?)**: Timeliness and relevance.
  - **Key Angles**: 2-3 specific perspectives to investigate.
  - **Interview Targets**: Suggested experts or stakeholders (e.g., "Ask a bank mortgage VP about X").
  - **Data Requirements**: What charts/tables are needed to prove the point.

### 3. Weekly Agenda

- **Deliverable**: A prioritized list of "Must-Watch" topics for the upcoming week based on the synthesis of current events.

## Editorial Standards

- **Objective Tone**: Avoid sensationalism.
- **Actionable Insight**: Focus on what the reader (investor/industry pro) needs to *do* or *know*.
- **Source Verification**: Flag unverified rumors clearly.
